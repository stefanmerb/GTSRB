# Overview
A convolutional neural network to classify German traffic signs

# Dataset
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011.
It has 43 classes and more than 50.000 pictures in total.

# Model
A own CNN is used and trained from scratch with Keras and Tensorflow.

# Metrics
This model achieves 96.49% on test data (12630 images).
